# icmp-android
Based on https://github.com/kirillF/icmp-android but updated to work on modern android

## Todo:
- [ ] Structure into a library and an app that uses it
- [ ] Release the library to maven central so it can be used
- [ ] Update the UI in the sample app so that users can select the IP to ping
- [ ] Ensure it works for ipv4 and ipv6
- [ ] Return correct results when a host is not reachable
